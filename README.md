## About the Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

The manual way of processing transactions in the barangay (**village**) is still prevalent
today. Filling out necessary records by using pen and paper that are stored in
log books and folders in the barangay (**village**). There are records which have been
distorted, some records are incomplete and there has been a loss of data.

Web application systems and mobile applications have helped in the tasks that we
perform on a daily basis. These applications assisted us to make our lives
easier in making transactions. With the emergence of technology in the
Philippines, the proposed system, which is the oneBarangay system, will handle
the main office of the barangay (**village**) to provide a systematic, efficient, and
technological way of handling online document issuing and more secure data.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing
purposes.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://
```

2. Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

3. Activate the virtual environment

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
```

4. Install the requirements

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

5. Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<NAME>
REDIS_URL=redis://<HOST>:<PORT>/0
```

6. Run the migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

7. Create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

8. Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

### Running the tests

#### With Django
```bash
python manage.py test
```

#### With Pytest
```bash
pytest
```

### Deployment

1. Create a `.env` file and add the following environment variables

```bash
DATABASE_URL=postgres://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/NAME
REDIS_URL=redis://HOST:PORT/0
DJANGO_SECRET_KEY=<your_secret_key>
DJANGO_ALLOWED_HOSTS=<your_host>
DJANGO_GCP_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME=<your_bucket_name>
DEFAULT_FROM_EMAIL=<your_email>
DJANGO_ADMIN_URL=<your_admin_url>
SENDGRID_API_KEY=<your_sendgrid_api_key>
SENDGRID_GENERATE_MESSAGE_ID=<your_sendgrid_generate_message_id>
SENDGRID_MERGE_FIELD_FORMAT=<your_sendgrid_merge_field_format>
SENTRY_DSN=<your_sentry_dsn>
```

2. Run the migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

3. Create a superuser

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

4. Run the server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

## Settings

Moved to [settings](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/settings.html).

## Basic Commands

### Setting Up Your Users

- To create a **normal user account**, just go to Sign Up and fill out the form. Once you submit it, you'll see a "
  Verify Your E-mail Address" page. Go to your console to see a simulated email verification message. Copy the link into
  your browser. Now the user's email should be verified and ready to go.

- To create an **superuser account**, use this command:

      $ python manage.py createsuperuser

For convenience, you can keep your normal user logged in on Chrome and your superuser logged in on Firefox (or similar),
so that you can see how the site behaves for both kinds of users.

### Type checks

Running type checks with mypy:

    $ mypy onebarangay_psql

### Pre-commit checks

Running pre-commit checks:

    $ pre-commit run --all-files

### Test coverage

To run the tests, check your test coverage, and generate an HTML coverage report:

    $ coverage run -m pytest
    $ coverage html
    $ open htmlcov/index.html

#### Running tests with pytest

    $ pytest

### Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation

Moved
to [Live reloading and SASS compilation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/live-reloading-and-sass-compilation.html).

### Email Server

In development, it is often nice to be able to see emails that are being sent from your application. If you choose to
use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog) when generating the project a local SMTP server with a web interface
will be available.

1. [Download the latest MailHog release](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog/releases) for your OS.

2. Rename the build to `MailHog`.

3. Copy the file to the project root.

4. Make it executable:

       $ chmod +x MailHog

5. Spin up another terminal window and start it there:

       ./MailHog

6. Check out <http://127.0.0.1:8025/> to see how it goes.

Now you have your own mail server running locally, ready to receive whatever you send it.

### Sentry

Sentry is an error logging aggregator service. You can sign up for a free account
at <https://sentry.io/signup/?code=cookiecutter> or download and host it yourself.
The system is set up with reasonable defaults, including 404 logging and integration with the WSGI application.

You must set the DSN url in production.

### Heroku

See
detailed [cookiecutter-django Heroku documentation](http://cookiecutter-django.readthedocs.io/en/latest/deployment-on-heroku.html).

## Roadmap

See the [open issues](https://github.com/PrynsTag/oneBarangay-REST-API/issues) for a list
of proposed features (and known issues) .
